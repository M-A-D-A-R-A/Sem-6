The main ideas of implementation were to analyze the source files and follow the basic ideas from python tutorial practice. For addition.py the only thing was to return the sum, for buyLotsOfFruit.py I added a loop which checks if the fruit is available and calculates the total cost else prints an error message and returns None. The main implementation was required in shopSmart.py to calculate the cheapest shop and the lowest price. I used the functions from shop.py i.e. FruitShop class to calculate the cost and then compared the price in a loop by swapping the lowest price and then returning its respective shop name.
