Other examples of sequence data include stock prices and  weather data over time. Videos, while containing still images, are also sequences. Elements in the data have a relationship with what comes before and what comes after, and this fact requires a different approach."

    "The results may be a bit underwhelming after 30 epochs of training.  We can notice that most of the headlines make some kind of grammatical sense, but don't necessarily indicate a good contextual understanding.  The results might improve somewhat by running more epochs. You can do this by runnning the training `fit` cell again (and again!) to train another 30 epochs each time.  You should see the loss value go down.  Then try the tests again.  Results can vary quite a bit!\n",

Some information on how to do that can be found [here](https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html).\n",

    "Ultimately, however, NLP has moved beyond simple LSTM models to Transformer-based pre-trained models, which are able to learn language context from huge amounts of textual data such as Wikipedia.  These pre-trained models are then used as a starting point for transfer learning to solve NLP tasks such as the one we just tried for text completion.  You can try one of these models yourself by checking out this [state-of-the-art text predictor here](https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large) based on a [GPT-2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).\n",
